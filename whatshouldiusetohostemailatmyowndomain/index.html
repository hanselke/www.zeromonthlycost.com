                            <h3><p>intro:
Email is the most important online service that we use today. Everyone has an e-mail account on Gmail, Yahoo, Rediff and Hotmail. It is your passport on the online space used to access to most apps and websites, but it’s often neglected. Today, in the year 2016, there is no business without e-mail accounts. Almost a majority of large enterprises, mid-size businesses, non-profit organizations, public administrations and small businesses have their email address that contains the name of their business. The email with your own domain name gives a professional demeanor to your customers and people you deal with in your business. Just like the personalized email address, a domain name is also important to a company&rsquo;s online identity. A deliberate domain name can help in building a positive brand image.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>Email is the most important online service you use — it’s essentially your online passport, used to login to most apps you use — but it’s often the most neglected. Sure, we check our email all the time — you may even run emailing marketing campaigns for your business — but how much time did you put into finding the best place to keep your email? Have you ever thought about the possibility of needing to switch email services, and how much that would affect your life?
Now’s the time to think about it. Let’s take a look at the best email services out there today, and how you use them to make sure you never lose all of your email. And perhaps, you’ll find an email service that you like even better than you’re using right now.</p>

<p>Wait: Isn’t Gmail OK?
Perhaps your current email solution is fine. It’s working now, after all. But the question isn’t about today, it’s about the future.
Remember the first email account you had, likely an old Hotmail or AOL account, or a company or school account, or possibly an email account from your ISP? Do you still use it today? Odds are, you don’t. And while Gmail is ubiquitous today, it’s actually only been around since 2004. 10 years from today, who’s to say what the dominant email provider will be.
When you rely on email for as many things as most of us do today, you need to make sure it’ll be around for the long haul. The best way to do that is to use your own domain for email. That way, no matter what service you use, you can get your email — and you can always switch to another service in the future if you want, without having to change your email address.
If you don’t have your own domain name, you should go ahead and invest in one. It’ll only cost around $10/year from most registrars, and you can find a nice one easily with apps like Domainr. Then, you can get email at yourname@yourdomain.com, and never worry again about having to switch emails.
Of course, if you have your own domain — or are running the email for your company — then you already know this, and just want to find the best place to host your email today. That’s what’s next.</p>

<p>Now, How Do I Get Email?
Got your own domain? Good. Now you’re ready to pick out the email service to use with your domain. The default choice for email on your own domain used to be Google Apps, as it used to have a free account for up to 10 email accounts per domain. That’s now gone, so it’s best to look around and see what’ll work best for you. The good news is, there’s a lot of great options. Here’s the best:</p>

Gmail, A Good Option ?
Google’s widely popular Gmail account is perhaps your current email solution and it is fine. You’re currently working on it now, but the question is about the future. Remember that Gmail is safe for work, and it’s actually since 2004. But who can say which one will be the dominant email provider 10 years from today. When you rely on email for your business and many other important things, you need to make sure it’ll be for the long haul. And, the best way to do that is to have an email with your own domain name. It doesn’t matter what email service you’re using, you can easily find so many choices for email accounts, and you can always switch to another service in the future if you want</p>

<p>zoho
Zoho offers professional email hosting that supports a range of web apps for business. It’s an impressive suite of web mails’ that support ad-free, clean and fast interface. The best solution for everything from accounting to CRM, you can get started with it up to 50 free users, or pay just a nominal amount for more storage and features. It has got features like multi-level folders, drag and drop, threaded view, tabbed views, mass selection, filtered views, anti-spam, instant chat, SAML authentication, and more.</p>

<p>&ndash;
Zoho makes a range of web apps for business, and offers an impressive suite of web apps for everything from accounting to CRM, and even offer professional email hosting. You can get started with it for free, or pay just $2.50/user/month for more storage and features. It’s got no ads, a familiar if slightly dated interface, push email and full sync support, and more.
Price: Free for up to 3 users, from $2.50/user/month after that</p>

<p>gapps for work
The free option in Gmail is already popular among users, but it’s not good for business purpose. You can get a personalized email address via Googles’ App Engine that’s one of the best options for getting your own email address. All you need to do is to make an account on App Engine, add your domain to the account, and then you’ll get a single Google Apps account with your domain. It’s really worth for those who want the Gmail experience. You get everything that you expect from Google Drive like 30GB of storage, shared calendars, video meetings, business-grade security controls, and real support.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>I know, I know: we just derided Gmail, and said the free option is gone. It is — though there’s a semi-official way to get a single email address on your own domain for free via Google’s App Engine, and that’s one of the best options still if you’re just wanting to use email yourself on your own email address. You’ll need to make an App Engine account, add your domain to the account, and then you’ll get a single Google Apps account with your domain. Not simple, but worth it if you really want the Gmail experience.
Beyond that, Google Apps cost $5/month for each user or email address you use on your domain. For that, you get everything you’d expect from Gmail and Google Drive, but with 30GB of storage and real support. If you’re someone who’s ever said you’d pay for Gmail, here’s your chance — this time, with your own domain, so you’ve still got the freedom to move to another service if you ever want to.
Price: $5/month, single email address accounts free if you jump through some hoops
office 365
Microsoft’s Office 365 offer business-class email that you can access from a web browser using Outlook Web App. Email account users get the full power of exchange in their own domain, with all the configuration options you’d want. You can enable secure access and sharing of documents with 10GB baseline storage along with 500MB of storage per user. To get access to its full applications, you have to pay a nominal amount, and get installed all Office applications in your account at Officecom Setup.</p>

For email on your own domain, Microsoft’s Office 365 for Business is where the main action is. Here, for $5/month, you can get the full power of Exchange on your own domain, with all the configuration options you’d want. You’ll have full Exchange push email, or IMAP and POP3 sync, and you can use the new Office 2013-styled Outlook Web Access to check your email online. Bump that up to $12.50/month for the Premium package, and you’ll also get access to full, installed Office applications, as well as Office on tablets and phones (up-to 5 tablets and 5 phones). Not such a bad deal, one that’s actually competitive with Google’s pricing.
Price:  $5/user/month for email and Office collaboration; $12.50/user/month for that plus Office for your desktop</p>

<p>atmail:
Atmail offers email hosting services and one of the best alternatives to Google Apps. Its interface is more effective than the Apple’s iCloud even it offer the features you’d expect from Gmail personalized email accounts. It costs very less and helps to reduce the expenses of business email while maintaining high standards. It offers every much better option you’d think of such as Exchange ActiveSync, IMAP, and POP3, One-click iOS provisioning, vCard support, multiple languages, multiple webmail theme and tools to manage the whole team.</p>

<p>Email is easily one of the most important web apps to most of our work and lives. You need your email to be fast, reliable, and work with all of your native email apps and on the web. If you’re signing up for a personal email account, odds are you’d sign up for Gmail, and if not, would use Outlook.com, iCloud Mail, or Yahoo! mail. For business, email, though, it’s a bit trickier of a question.
Google Apps used to be the simplest option for email on your own domain, but it went from allowing 50 users free per account to just 10, and then recently removed the option for free Apps on your domain without a workaround. Otherwise, it’ll now cost you $5/user/month, and now doesn’t include ActiveSync push. Outlook.com lets you use it with your own domain, but it’s not nearly as powerful for business use, and Microsoft’s more professional Office 365 with Exchange support costs $4/user/month.
Then there’s Atmail Cloud. Atmail has been around as a webmail app for self-hosted email since 1998, and has an interface and feature set that could rival most of the popular consumer-facing email apps. You can run it on your own server, or buy an Atmail appliance, but here we’re going to look at their new hosted service, Atmail Cloud, that gives you online email, calendar, and contacts with Exchange ActiveSync for just $2/user/month.
Atmail Admin
Getting started with Atmail Cloud is actually a tad less confusing than Google Apps’ setup was, back when I setup my domain with it. You can start out with a free 14 day trial to make sure everything’s up and running perfectly before you pay, and then as mentioned before, Atmail Cloud costs $2/user/month, with 10Gb of storage per user, though it requires a minimum of 5 accounts.
From there, setup is easy, guiding you through everything you need to get started – such as switching your domain’s DNS MX records to Atmail, and adding user accounts manually or via a CSV file import. One odd thing for a business email tool is that there’s no way at the moment to import old emails, contacts, and calendar events into Atmail; you need to start 100% fresh. There are ways to migrate email over IMAP, and a Gmail import option is planned in the near future.</p>

<p>Setting up Atmail Cloud
Beyond that, there’s pretty much everything you could think of. You can add custom branding, manage multiple domains and sets of users, and even resell the email to your customers (say, a web designer could setup and manage Atmail Cloud for a client, but with their own design firm’s branding and perhaps a price tag of $3/month/user). You can also add a custom tagline for all emails sent from accounts on your Atmail Cloud, but unless your business requires a legal message, I’d recommend leaving this off and let each of your users add their own email signature, since any tagline you set cannot be changed by individual users.
Once accounts are setup, you can easily setup mail, contacts, and calendar sync with all of your favorite apps, just like you’d expect. Once nice thing is that you can also setup Atmail Cloud on your iPhone or iPad with just a single tap thanks to its profile settings. This isn’t the best way to setup Atmail, though, if you’d like to have push email, as it only sets up IMAP email sync. The good thing is, Atmail works great with native apps, just as fast as you’d expect, so if you’re looking for a great service to use with native apps, there’s not much more you could ask for. It supports IMAP, POP3, CalDAV and CardDAV, so all modern PIM apps should work great with Atmail.</p>

The Atmail Webapp
Then, if you’d prefer to check your email, contacts, and calendar online, the Atmail webapp is easily one of the nicest email web apps, though it’s still lacking in a few frustrating ways. First up, though, it’s very nicely designed, with a 2-column Gmail style interface as well as a 3 column interface that in many ways is reminiscent of iCloud’s web apps. It’s a clean and modern design, and works just as you’d expect. Inline email replies, options to view the email header (and email app used to send the email – a geeky fun-fact), bulk-select, and more are all built-in.</p>

<p>Atmail’s email interface
Atmail’s email interface feels fairly fluid, and emails load as quick as you’d expect, though oddly you won’t find conversation view. Atmail is based on folders like most email systems, but unlike Gmail which uses tags. The built-in email filters seem to work pretty much as expected, picking up two newsletters and a purchase receipt automatically, and you can add more email filters from the settings. And one very nice option when you’re writing an email is the Attach from Storage option, which lets you choose attachments from files you’ve already saved in the Atmail Storage section.</p>

<p>Adding attachments in Atmail
The contacts and Calendar also work much as you’d expect, with the calendar feeling even more similar to Apple’s iCloud Calendar web app. It’s easy to use, with iOS-style pop-overs for entering events and more, and supports repeating dates and sharing events with others. What’s frustrating, though, is that it’s not more integrated with the email side. In the demo account, one email message included an iCal file with an event as an attachment. Clicking that attachment only saved it to my Mac, rather than opening it in Atmail Calendar like I would have hoped it would.</p>

<p>Atmail Calendar
The same frustration was felt with the Storage app in Atmail. You can save files to it to quickly add to emails as attachments, and all you’ll need to do that is to drag-and-drop files to the browser from your computer. Frustratingly, though, there’s no way to move attachments to the storage without downloading them to your computer first, then re-uploading them. The storage won’t show all files in your account, but rather only the files you’ve expressly added to the storage app. So, if there’s one thing we’d really like to see, it’d be more integration between Atmail’s web apps.
Conclusion
Atmail Cloud is a great hosted email service for your own domain, with one of the nicest interfaces and ActiveSync, something that’s an increasingly rare option now that Google Apps dropped it. It’s easy to setup, easy to use, and works great with email apps. Its web app isn’t as robust as we’d like, but as an alternate to Google’s $5/user/month Apps, it’s a great alternate for small and medium businesses.
You’ll still need to have at least 5 users to use Atmail, though some web hosts like Media Temple offer Atmail to their users if you’d like the same features for your personal email on your own domain. And, the Atmail team says they’re planning smaller account options in the future.
If you’ve used Atmail – in the cloud or on your own server – we’d love to hear about your experiences in the comments below.</p>

<hr />

<p>The nicest looking third-party alternate to Exchange and Google Apps is Atmail Cloud, hands-down. We loved it in our review, even if it did still have a few rough edges, and found its interface to be more on par with Apple’s iCloud even while it offered more of the features you’d expect from Gmail. There’s every sync option you’d think of — Exchange ActiveSync, IMAP, and POP3 — and tools to manage a whole team. And it only costs $2/month for its beautiful web apps and great service. The only problem is, it won’t work so good if you only need one email address on your domain, since it requires a minimum of 5 users. There is one alternate, though: if you host your website with Media Temple, you can get their Atmail powered email for free.
Price: $2/user/month, though a minimum of 5 users</p>

<p>fastmail:</p>

<p>If you follow a number of tech blogs, you’ve likely heard of people switching to FastMail. It’s been the most popular alternate to Google Apps for email on your own domain for years now, and for good reason. It’s cheap, starting at just $40/year for one email address on your own domain. Its web apps might leave something to be desired — though they are improving rapidly — but you can sync with any email app you want via IMAP and POP3. And, there’s family account options and business email options if you need more than just one account. One interesting fact: FastMail is owned by Opera, the browser company that never can quite get much traction in the desktop browser market.
Price: $40+/year for your own domain</p>

<p>secure suite by the email laundry:</p>

<p>Security is a huge issue when choosing a cloud-based email provider, and The Email Laundry prides itself on its secure features, offering a service that filters your email for spam and viruses. It also features a web security service, designed to provide browsing protection for all your users. The Secure Suite business email service offers 25GB mailboxes, along with server-side MAPI, Active Sync functionality, and automatic email backups. The product also supports company contact sharing and resource booking. Pricing is competitive at $4 per mailbox per month.
Price: $4/month per mailbox</p>
